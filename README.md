# redoubt üè∞

redoubt is a simple, yet powerful & secure [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express/) based server.

## Why?

I recently cam to realize that most of my projects incorporating a web server end up containing the exact same server boilerplate code:

 * A JSON Body Parser
 * A URL Encoded Parser
 * A static file directory somewhere
 * An (optional) cookie based session storage
 * And last but not least SSL certificates

The first four are rather trivial to set up, the last one would travidionally be a bit tricky and/or costly. 

Thankfully, [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is giving aways certificates, so we've got **free, automatically renewed certificates** built in.

## Quick Start

Install the library into your project:

```
npm i redoubt
```

You are ready to set up your server:

```js
const Redoubt = require("redoubt");
const path = require("path");
const fs = require("fs");

const server = new Redoubt({
  // The name of your server
  name: "my-redoubt-server",
  // Let's Encrypt will issue our certificates(We need to specify some details about our domain)
  certs: "letsEncrypt",
  agreeGreenlockTos: true,
  domains: ["patrick-sachs.de"],
  webmasterMail: "the-webmaster-mail@patrick-sachs.de"
  // We also serve some static files
  staticFiles: { from: path.resolve(__dirname, "./static"), serve: "/" },
  // 
  cookieSecret: "maggots-at-the-party",
});
// Express app exposed via "app" - Set up your actual server here!
server.app.get("/api/data", (req, res) => res
  .json({ values: ["express", "test"] })
  .end());
// Let's rock! ü§ò
server.listen();
```

The code above is an example for a production server. Production servers using `certs: "letsEncrypt"` need a public FQDN in order for Let's Encrypt to be able to issue certificates to it.

For development server, we can either set `isDevelopment: true`, or use manually created certificates:

```js
certs: {
  cert: fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, "./server.crt")),
  key: fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, "./key.pem")),
  allowUnsigned: true
},
```

See the `/example/index.js` file for a complete development server example.

## All properties

| Key | Description | Type | Default/Required |
| - | - | - | - |
| `name` | The name of your server. Currently only used for the name of the session cookie, but this might change in the future. | `string` | ‚úîÔ∏è Required |
| `domains` | The domain names the Let's Encrypt certificates should be issued against. The first value is your primary domain. Must all be valid, resolvable FQDNs. Simply pass `localhost` in a development envrionment. | `string[]` | ‚úîÔ∏è Required |
| `webmasterMail` | The mail of the webmaster. Used by Let's Encrypt to conact you when something related to your certificates happens(about to be renewed...). | `string` | ‚úîÔ∏è Required |
| `isDevelopment` | If this server running in development mode? Development mode servers do not compress, do not request valid SSL certificates and trust invalid SSL certificates. | `boolean` | `false` |
| `certs` | The certificates your server uses. You can either use Let's Encrypt or your your own certificates(e.g. if you are running in a company internal network). Keep in mind that when using manually generated certificates, `key` and `cert` must contain the certificate & key file contents, not their file paths. | `"letsEncrypt" | { key: string, cert: string, allowUnsigned: boolean }` | `"letsEncrypt"` |
| `letsEncryptCertDirectory` | When using Let's Encrypt certificates, this is where they will be stored. Must be a directory with write access. | `string` | `"./.certs/"` |
| `agreeGreenlockTos` | The greenlock library used to create the Let's Encrypt certificates requires you to explictly accept their TOS. | `boolean` | `false` |
| `staticFiles` | Allows you to serve static files. File location on your server is specified in `from`, and URL users will be able to access them from in `serve`. | `{ from: string, serve: string } | null` | `null` |
| `maxPayloadSize` | The max size in bytes a single JSON or URL encoded request to the server can have. | `number` | `100 * 1024` |
| `debug` | Allows to to specify your own debug function(Or disable debug by passing `null`). By default the console is used. | `((level: string, ...args: any[]) => void) | null` | `console.log("[" + level + "]", "üè∞ ", ...args)` |

## Questions

 * *I'm getting an error about greenlock TOS!* - Please read about the `agreeGreenlockTos` option.
 * *My development server is "Not Secure"!* - This is expected. Let's Encrypt can't issue certificates for `localhost`. As long as the `domains` option if correct on your production server it will work there.
 * *I don't want to use port 443 & 80!* - The `listen(https: number, http: number | null)` function allows you to customize the ports. You can also pass null as second parameter to disable the HTTP server redirection.
 * *How do I access the user session data?* - See the express-session documentation: https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session

Feel free to go ahead and do so. I'm very open when it comesto PRs, Issues and Feature Requests.

This project is written in TypeScript and has a very minimal setup and configuration.
